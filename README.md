# Let's pet!

## Sample web app where you can rent a pet. Written in React.

This is a practice website where as a junior web developer I can try out new technologies on an interesting topic.
Please also look at the descriptions of the animals, browse among them, you will find many funny topics.
For the development of the website I used HTML, CSS, React.js, React-bootstrap and mock data, considering that the application had to be completed in a short time.
There are many more plans to implement modernization, design and other functional features, so please come back to the site sometimes, because you will definitely find more and more improvements later ...
